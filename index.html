<p>CIT 330 - UnderTheWire Cyborg Solutions</p>
<pre>
    It's not the prettiest write up, and it may not help you fully wrap your head around what all goes into each level of UTW Cyborg, 
    but this document will hopefully give you some idea of how to solve the various UTW Cyborg levels that you might have struggled with.
    
    Some of you may have found the same or similar solution, but if not, then maybe you'll see another way of thinking and
    approaching the problem!
    
    All items are just my thoughts and processes that I logged while going through UTW Cyborg in prep for assigning it to you in CIT 330.
    
    I had completed UTW Cyborg earlier this year without taking any notes, so this was basically a quick blind run, as my notes will make apparent.
    
    Not all levels have full explanations - some only include the solution(s). If I had to stop and think, 
    I tried my best to jot down what I was thinking and what I would end up finding after some quick research.
    
    I also must remind everyone that I have never claimed to be a PowerShell wizard, and so in a few spots I admit confusion.
    
    Never be afraid to admit confusion, but do try and use it as an opporutnity to learn a thing.
