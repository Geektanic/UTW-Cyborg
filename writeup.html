        I can't find a Chris Rogers with any super simple queries such as:
        Get-ADUser -Filter {Name -eq "Chris Rogers"}
        or
        Get-ADUser -Filter {Name -like "Chris Rogers"}
        Try seeing if we can get a hit on just a surname:
        Get-ADUser -Filter {Surname -eq "Rogers"}
        
        We found him, now lets see if we can get the State attribute.
        It's probably going to be easiest to base things on his SamAccountName of "chris.rogers":
        Get-ADUsers chris.rogers -Properties State

        Lots of ways to do this.
        We can assume DNS zone is underthewire.tech, but can double check:
        Get-DnsServerZone
        A Record for CYBORG718W100N:
        Get-DnsServerResourceRecord -ZoneName "underthewire.tech" -Name "CYBORG718W100N"
        
        Much shorter:
        Resolve-DnsName CYBORG718W100N
        
        If you're not interested in learning PowerShell today:
        ping CYBORG718W100N

        Confirm we can just use "Cyborg" to query group stuff:
        Get-AdGroup Cyborg
        Ok, maybe list out all the members just to see if its like...two, whic makes this easy:
        Get-AdGroupMember Cyborg
        Nope, that's a lot, let's count:
        Get-ADGroupMember Cyborg | Measure-Object

        We can just list everything available and scroll:
        Get-Module -ListAvailable
        That's not much fun. Let's see if we can narrow it down:
        Get-Module -ListAvailable | Where-Object {$_.Version -eq "8.9.8.9"}

        We should be able to just filter using the LogonHours attribute:
        Get-ADUser -Filter {LogonHours -like "*"}
        This returned both the Administrator and another user - I'll assume since Administrator doesn't have a last name, that's not it.
        I'm not sure if I can make something to get it down to just the other user.

        It looks like some people haven't cleaned up their previous work, so we won't cheat and open the "output" like files.
        cat cypher.txt
        Returning a string that ends with "==", which makes me assume base64. PowerShell has built in base64 encode/decode capabilties.
        I don't remember them off the top of my head. After some Googling and wrangling the syntax I come up with:
        [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String("YwB5AGIAZQByAGcAZQBkAGQAbwBuAA=="))
        
        Playing around with variables:
        $geekvar = Get-Content .\cypher.txt
        [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($geekvar))

        Like a previous item we can use CIM pretty easily since we're logged in as the user we're interested in:
        Get-CimInstance Win32_StartupCommand
        
        I decided to try out something based on their hint:
        Get-ChildItem -Path HKCU: -Recurse | Where-OBject {$_.Name -like "*Run*"}
        
        If you know exactly where to look this works:
        Get-ItemProperty "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"

        This feels similar enough to an earlier one we're just going to adapt:
        Get-ADUser -Filter {telephoneNumber -like "*876-5309*"}

        I don't remember anything about this. Using the built in help I tried a few combos and found:
        Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective -XML
        It's formatting sucks, but you can spot the description.
        
        After Googling I found the Microsoft doc on Select-Xml and couldn't get it to do anything. Found some online discussions on expanding
        out XML properties. Maybe give it a whirl.
        $geekxml = [xml](Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective -XML)
        $geekxml.AppLockerPolicy.RuleCollection | Select-Object -ExpandProperty ChildNodes | where {$_.name -like '*ill_be_back.exe*'}

        Knowing IIS installs to C:\inetpub we check it out and find the location of the log file in question and move to directory:
        cd C:\inetpub\logs\logfiles\w3svc1
        
        After scoping the file out it looks like we're going to need to essentially read the content and find/select an entry
        where something other than Mozilla or Opera accessed the server. Since all the lines include a user agent string, lets assume the password
        entry won't include the terms "Mozilla" or "Opera":
        Get-Content u_ex160413.log | Select-String -NotMatch -Pattern "Mozilla|Opera"

        A lot of things going on. Maybe break it down:
        1. Find what started "i_heart_robots" service
        2. Pass full path from above to base64 decoding
        3. Use first four characters + desktop file
        
        Using a base from UTW Century and adding a select for PathName:
        Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Service | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like "i_heart_robots"} | Select-Object PathName
        
        Working with some previous knowledge about base64 decoding, we're going to work the other direction and encode instead:
        [Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes('c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe'))

        This should be simple with the various DNS tools in PowerShell:
        Get-DNSServerZoneAging underthewire.tech

        Using their hint, I assume we're going to be going back to the Cim stuff:
        Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_DCOMApplicationSetting
        Buuuut that's obviously too much output. It looks like we'll probably want to filter on "AppID" so let's filter based on what we're looking for:
        Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_DCOMApplicationSetting | where 'AppID' -eq "{59B8AFA0-229E-46D9-B980-DDA2C817EC7E}"
